Click on “Request Now” in order to get institutional access to a JetBrains account. (Note: for this you will need your school credentials).

Since you have already set up your Github account, and set up a repository, open the Webstorm editor and click the “menu” for settings.
Click “New” and click “Project from Version Control”.
Make sure you also have Github open because you will need to locate the repository you want to clone to Webstorm.
On Github, after you have located the repository, click on the green “< > Code” button. Copy the path for the repository and paste it into where the URL section on Webstorm is.
Click “Clone” .
On Webstorm, create a file - Click “File”.
Click “New”.
Click “HTML File”.
For a stylesheet, repeat steps 9 & 10 and click on “Stylesheet”.
If you want to add the files to Git, click “Add”.

**Clone** - Making a copy of a repository on your own computer.
**Commit** - Saving your changes with a small message explaining what you have done.
**Fetch** - Checking the updates from Github without applying them.
**GIT** - It is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time.
**Github** - A website where you are able to store, as well as share, Git projects online.
